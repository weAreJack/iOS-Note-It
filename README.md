# Note it! - A notes app built using a table view.
Note it! allows users to easily create, edit, store and delete notes. 

This project centers around managing a UITableview to display a number of editable cells, each representing a note. Tap on the cell to open up the note and edit the headings or content of the note.

This project is developed programmatically, without the use of storyboards. Demonstrates the use of the MVC architecture for simple apps, and makes use of user defaults to store small amounts of data locally.
